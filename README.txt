Hello! this is my first actual open source project, so i may be a little slow to get what you mean sometimes, sorry in advance!
to use this extension, simply open the ClassWizard menu in the Tools menu bar in visual studio

there you will have a new window appear,in order to be able to generate a class, you must first select a destination,
then you should enter your class' name, click generate, and the class will be where you put it!
You can now inherit from the classes in the solution!
also feed back when the class is created
