Hello! this is my first actual open source project, so i may be a little slow to get what you mean sometimes, sorry in advance!
to use this extension, simply open the ClassWizard menu in the Tools menu bar in visual studio

there you will have a new window appear,in order to be able to generate a class, you must first select a destination,
then you should enter your class' name, click generate, and the class will be where you put it!

notes:
right now, there is no feedback on wether or not the class was generated.
i am also working on making it so you can inherit from a class in the solution, along with the include to said path
